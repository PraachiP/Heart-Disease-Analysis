# Heart-Disease-Analysis 

## Introduction :-

Health is real wealth in the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on
all irrespective of any status. We are required to analyze this health and medical data for
better future preparation.
Heart disease (HD) is one of the most common diseases nowadays, and an early diagnosis of such a disease is a crucial task for many health care providers to prevent their patients for such a disease and to save lives. 

The health care industries collect huge amounts of data that contain some hidden information, which is useful for making effective decisions. For providing appropriate results and making effective decisions on data, some data science techniques need to be used. The data analysis predicts the likelihood of patients getting heart disease. It enables significant knowledge. E.g. Relationships between medical factors related to heart disease and patterns, to be established. The obtained results have illustrated that the designed diagnostic system can effectively predict the risk level of heart diseases.


## FINDINGS :-
The aim of this project is to predict heart disease based on various factors.

## DATASET USED :-
The Heart disease data set consists of patient data. The combined dataset consists of 14 features and 916 samples with many missing values. The features used in here are,

age: The patients age in years

sex: The patients gender(1=male; 0=female)

cp: Chest pain type, *Value 1: typical angina *Value 2: atypical angina *Value 3: non-anginal pain *Value 4: asymptomatic

trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

chol: Serum cholestoral in mg/dl

fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl? (1=true; 0=false)

restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results 
*Value 0: normal *Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV) 
*Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved

exang: Chest pain(angina) after exercise? (1=yes; 0=no)

thal: Not described *Value 3=normal *Value 6=treated defect *Value 7=reversible defect

num: Target 
*Value 0: less than 50% narrowing of coronary arteries(no heart disease) 
*Value 1,2,3,4: >50% narrowing. The value indicates the stage of heart disease
