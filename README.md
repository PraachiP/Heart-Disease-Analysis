# Heart-Disease-Analysis :-

Health is real wealth in the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on
all irrespective of any status. We are required to analyze this health and medical data for
better future preparation.

# FINDINGS :-
The aim of this project is to predict heart disease based on various factors.

# DATASET USED :-
The Heart disease data set consists of patient data. The combined dataset consists of 14 features and 916 samples with many missing values. The features used in here are,

age: The patients age in years

sex: The patients gender(1=male; 0=female)

cp: Chest pain type, *Value 1: typical angina *Value 2: atypical angina *Value 3: non-anginal pain *Value 4: asymptomatic

trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

chol: Serum cholestoral in mg/dl

fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl? (1=true; 0=false)

restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results 
*Value 0: normal *Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV) 
*Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved

exang: Chest pain(angina) after exercise? (1=yes; 0=no)

thal: Not described *Value 3=normal *Value 6=treated defect *Value 7=reversible defect

num: Target 
*Value 0: less than 50% narrowing of coronary arteries(no heart disease) 
*Value 1,2,3,4: >50% narrowing. The value indicates the stage of heart disease
